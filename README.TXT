INSTRUCTIONS

To be able to run the FamiBank application Python 3.9 needs to be installed in your computer.

To run our FamiBank program open the Delivery5 folder in your terminal and install the modules, typing:
pip install -r requirements.txt

After the modules have been installed, run the following command in the terminal:
python FamiBank.py

If you wish to see the database, you will have to download MongoDB Compass and paste in the connection string (mongodb+srv://admin:admin@cluster0.diqaz.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority) that can also be found in Account.py 8th line. After the connection has been pasted in, it will allow to access the test-database.test-collection where the information on FamiBank users is stored.
